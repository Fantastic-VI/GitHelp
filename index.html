            <section>
                <div>
                    <ul class="tenTips">
                        <li>IS ID yourself when you're coming in and out and going down to a room, say hello and say
                            goodbye and introduce your name.</li>
                        <li>Ask about their level of sight you don't know how much support they need until you know how
                            much they can see or can't see.</li>
                        <li>In a group situation make sure it's clear how many people are in the group and who you are,
                            and if you are leaving then make that clear as well.</li>
                        <li>Description don't say "over here" or "over there", let them know. Tell them exactly where it
                            is, be descriptive.</li>
                        <li>Again is about support, don't just give support ask first some people want it, some people
                            don't.</li>
                        <li>Using everyday language so some people become very conscious of saying things like "see you
                            later" or "did you watch that movie last night?". You can still use all that kind of
                            everyday language to just be normal basically.</li>
                        <li>A third person. When out in a group and you see a VI, don't go through somebody else to
                            speak to them, speak to them directly. </li>
                        <li>On the same sort of tilt use normal body language, so even if somebody can't see that you're
                            gesturing your hands around like I do or making eye contact, then still do that because that
                            will mean that the way you talk is more natural.</li>
                        <li>Explain loud noises that may startle a person, such as building works or alarms.</li>
                        <li style="padding-left: 35%;">Relax yourself.</li>
                    </ul>
