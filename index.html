        <h1>10 TIPS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH SOMEONE WITH SIGHT LOSS</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>IS ID yourself when you're coming in and out and going down to a room, say hello and say goodbye and introduce your name.</li>
            <li>Ask about their level of sight you don't know how much support they need until you know how much they can see or can't see.</li>
            <li>In a group situation make sure it's clear how many people are in the group and who you are, and if you are leaving then make that clear as well.</li>
            <li>Description don't say "over here" or "over there", let them know. Tell them exactly where it is, be descriptive.</li>
            <li>Again is about support, don't just give support ask first some people want it, some people don't.</li>
            <li>Using everyday language so some people become very conscious of saying things like "see you later" or "did you watch that movie last night?". You can still use all that kind of everyday language to just be normal basically.</li>
            <li>A third person. When out in a group and you see a VI, don't go through somebody else to speak to them, speak to them directly. </li>
            <li>Relax yourself.</li>
            <li>On the same sort of tilt use normal body language, so even if somebody can't see that you're gesturing your hands around like I do or making eye contact, then still do that because that will mean that the way you talk is more natural.</li>
            <li>Explain loud noises that may startle a person, such as building works or alarms.</li>
        </ol>
